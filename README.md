# Winfinitrix2
I made a plugin in October of last year and dubbed it "Winfinitricks"
It was actually a pretty cool project, unfortunately it (and the original version of AdminCentre) was lost to time. Betcha didnt know that AC2 is named AC2 because of this.

## TODO
- [ ] Reimplement the original AdminCentre (A nightmare)
- [ ] Fix update checks
- [ ] Add more commands & remote server management maybe?

## Setup
Don't know what I was on back then but it does require a license server. I've made a [fake one you can deploy anywhere](https://notthehub.windevsystems.us/hwalker/wtrx-fake-license-server)
Recommended IDE is IntelliJ IDEA (I use Ultimate, but you can use Community)
